Ducks have a unique adaptation in their feathers that makes them waterproof. This allows them to stay dry while swimming and diving for food. They are also known for their migratory patterns, traveling long distances during different seasons.

Ducks play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control insect populations and contributing to the health of aquatic environments.
