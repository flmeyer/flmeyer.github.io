# Abstract

This dissertation explores techniques for adaptive multi-hop networks in the IIoT concerning time-varying, dynamically changing traffic. It demonstrates that efficient transmission of management traffic is crucial for high adaptability in IEEE 802.15.4 DSME, develops several techniques to increase adaptability and validates them through simulations, hardware experiments, and analytical models. In particular, QMA reduces collisions in management traffic by learning when it is feasible to transmit a packet. Sending multiple packets per GTS and group acknowledgments further relieve the management traffic load. Finally, dynamic CAP-reduction enables a fine-grained trade-off between management and data traffic.
