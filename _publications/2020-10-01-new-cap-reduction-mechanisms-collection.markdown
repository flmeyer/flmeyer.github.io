In 2015, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was expanded by the Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME) to increase reliability, scalability and energy-efficiency in industrial applications. The extension offers a TDMA/FDMA-based channel access, where time is divided into two alternating phases, a contention access period (CAP) and a contention free period (CFP). During the CAP, transmission slots can be allocated offering an exclusive access to the shared medium during the CFP. The fraction of CFP’s time slots in a dataframe is a critical value, because it directly influences agility and throughput. A high throughput demands that the CFP is much longer than the CAP, i.e., a high value of , because application data is only sent during the CFP. High agility is given if the expected waiting time to send a CAP message is short and that the length of the CAPs are long enough to accommodate necessary GTS negotiations, i.e., a low value of . Once DSME is configured according to the needs of an application, can only assume one of two values and cannot be changed at run-time. In this paper, we propose two extensions of DSME that allow to adopt to the current traffic pattern. We show theoretically and through simulations that the proposed extensions provide a high degree of responsiveness to traffic fluctuations while keeping the throughput high.
