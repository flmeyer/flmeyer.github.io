The Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME) protocol is a recent amendment to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It combines contention-based and time-division medium access, offers channel diversity, and is aimed to support IIoT applications with stringent requirements in terms of timeliness and reliability. In this paper, we show how to configure DSME for a given data collection task. This includes the definition of the slot and frame length and the slot and channel schedule. We formulate different scheduling strategies as linear programs minimizing latency and energy. We verify our results through theoretical analysis and simulations and compare them with state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms. The results indicate a reduced delay of up to 80% for deep networks while also increasing reliability. Additionally, the proposed scheduling strategies significantly reduce the required buffer size.
