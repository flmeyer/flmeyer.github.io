Redirected walking is a technique that enables users to ex-
plore a walkable virtual environment that is larger than the
extent of the available physical space by manipulating the
usersâ€™ movements.
For the proper application of this technique, it is neces-
sary to determine the detection thresholds for the applied
manipulations. In this paper an experiment to measure the
detection levels of redirected walking manipulations in an
audio-visual virtual environment is described and the re-
sults are presented and compared to previous results of a
purely acoustically controlled redirected walking experi-
ment.
