# Hi, I'm Florian.

I am a software engineer based in Hamburg, specializing in the design of distributed systems with a focus on microservice architectures and sensor networks. I love tackling complex problems and turning them into simple, scalable solutions. As a full-stack engineer, I work across infrastructure, backend, and frontend. I am particularly excited about the potential of AI to transform workflows and drive greater efficiency. I am committed to delivering high-quality software on time and within budget.
